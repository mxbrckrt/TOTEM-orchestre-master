Orchestre Totem dev space

- Ableton-Sessions = mostly the place where built matrial is. Should be only functional material BUT you will need to download the M4L-plugs folder first
- M4L-plugs = max for live builds
- MaxMSP devs = MaxMSP tests and devs. Main work place where most ideas are sketched
- OLD-patches = dump space
- rnbo-dev = trying to make efficient rnbo stuff.
